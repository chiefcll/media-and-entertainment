# Slide 1

Hi there. Welcome to this year's TPAC, which is brought to you from desk chairs and couches around the world.


# Slide 2

My name is Pierre-Anthony Lemieux and I am based in San Francisco, California.

This is a brief overview of the Media and Entertainment Interest Group, which I co-chair with Chris Needham from the BBC and Tatsuya Igarashi from Sony.


# Slide 3

The IG is a hub for all activities related to media playback and authoring on the web

The IG was formed back in 2011, when it was called the Web and TV IG, just as TV was making its way to the web

The IG now has 52 member entities from across the community.


# Slide 4

The activities of the IG centers around developing requirements for new media features on the web platform.

As part of these activities, the IG reviews proposed specifications and coordinates with external organizations, some of which you might have heard of like MPEG, DASH-IF, CTA, SMPTE.

The objective is to make it easy to use the web platform for media experiences worldwide.


# Slide 5

For example, the IG has recently reviewed a client-side video editing API specification and a web codecs API specification

Going back in time, the IG was involved with specifications such as Picture-in-Picture.

It was also the primary driver in the development of the Media Source Extension and Encrypted Media Extensions specifications


# Slide 6

Another recent activity has been the development of requirements for media time events, with the objective of allowing application to synchronize events precisely with audio and video playback.

The output of this activity is taking shape in the form of the DataCue API currently being refined by the Web Incubator Community Group (WICG).

This activity is being conducted in collaboration with the DASH Industry Forum, which is an example of work with external organizations that I mentioned earlier. 


# Slide 7

The IG is also tackling requirements for bullet chatting (or danmu), which is a shared experience where user comments are overlaid in real-time over a video -- think of twitch chat over video. The question raised is whether the web platform has the necessary hooks to supports that experience.


# Slide 8

Last but not least, the IG is currently exploring two emerging areas.

The first one is driven by professional production assets moving to the cloud -- something unimaginable just a few years ago. This is in turn driving the need to web-based production tools.

While the web platform makes it possible for everyone to watch tv online, creating tv content requires more advanced capabilities like support for professional video codecs and super-accurate media synchronization.

This is an area where the IG is actively looking for the right participants, so please reach out if you are interested.


# Slide 9

Another area of interest is improving interoperability between media players, which, for instance, must deal with limited hardware decoding resources.

As an initial step, the IG has created draft Web Media Integration Guidelines.


# Slide 10

... and this brings us to the end of our tour of the Media and Entertainment IG. If you are interested, please do join us, we would love to have you.
